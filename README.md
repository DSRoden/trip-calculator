trip-calculator
===============

This repository contains a trip calculator that prompts the user for the following: 

- the distance he/she plans to travel
- the price of gas per gallon
- the number of gallons his/her tank takes when it is full
- the vehicle's advertised miles per gallon rating
- the speed at which he/she plans to drive
- the type of vehicle he/she is driving 

The trip calculator presents the user with the following output:

- The predicted cost of the trip
- The true gallons per mile 
- The number of tanks that the car will run through over the course of the trip

Improvements that could be made include:

- refactor some of the code becuase it is currently a little bit 'chunky'
